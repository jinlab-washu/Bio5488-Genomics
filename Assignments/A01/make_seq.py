"""make_seq.py prints a random sequence given a sequence length and nucleotide frequencies.  The random sequence will have the same nucleotide frequencies as the input nucleotide frequencies.

<sequence_length> = 1000000
<a_freq> = frequency of As
<c_freq> = frequency of Cs

## Part 4
### TODO Generate a random nucleotide sequence

# Initialize an empty string that nucleotides can be appended to

# Create a for loop that will be repeated <sequence_length> times
#     Generate a random decimal
#     Use if/else if/else logic to determine which nucleotide to add
#     Append the nucleotide to the nucleotide sequence

# Print the full nucleotide sequence
