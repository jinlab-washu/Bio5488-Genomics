# BIO 5488: Genomics — Spring 2026  
## Assignments & Lab (RIS)

Welcome to the **BIO 5488 Genomics assignments and lab repository**. This GitHub repository supports the **assignment-driven lab component** of the course and focuses on helping you run genomic analyses using **WashU Research Infrastructure Services (RIS)**.

This repository provides **local copies of assignment materials**, documents where those assignments already exist on RIS, and serves as a guide for navigating the RIS computing environment. It also explains how to organize and submit your work for grading.

## Course Links

- [**Course main page**](https://sites.wustl.edu/bio5488/)
- [**Syllabus**](https://sites.wustl.edu/bio5488/syllabus-2025/)
- [**Assignment policies**](https://sites.wustl.edu/bio5488/assignment-policies/)

These pages contain the official course description, policies, grading information, and important deadlines.

## Assignments 

Each assignment is a hands-on, computational exercise designed to introduce you to:
- Real genomic and epigenomic datasets  
- Command-line (Linux) workflows  
- Running analyses on shared compute infrastructure  
- Organizing and documenting reproducible results  

There is no separate wet lab component. All lab work is performed computationally through these assignments.

---

## How This GitHub Repository Is Used

You will use this GitHub repository to:

- Access **local copies of assignment instructions**
- See where each assignment is located within the RIS course directories
- Learn how to navigate the RIS file system
- Reference example commands and workflows
- Understand how to submit completed work

Materials in this repository should be treated as **reference copies**. You will complete all work within your assigned RIS workspace.

## GETTING STARTED WITH RIS

All assignment and lab work for BIO 5488 is completed on **WashU Research Infrastructure Services (RIS)**. RIS provides:

- Secure storage for large genomic datasets  
- Linux-based servers for computation  
- A shared environment similar to what is used in research labs  

You will access RIS via the command line (SSH). No prior HPC experience is required—each assignment includes step-by-step guidance.


At a high level, completing assignments in this course involves:

1. Logging into RIS
   
   👉 [RIS Guide: How to Log In](RIS_GUIDE/How_To_Login/README.md)
   
2. Locating the BIO 5488 course directories and Organizing results for submission
   
   👉 [RIS Guide: Navigating BIO5488 Assignments Directories Structure & Workflow Tour](RIS_GUIDE/Navigating_Directories_Tour/README.md)
   
3. Running analysis commands or jobs on RIS
   
   👉 [RIS Guide: Submitting Jobs](RIS_GUIDE/Submitting_Jobs/README.md)


Detailed instructions are provided within each assignment.

## Working on & Turning In Assignments on RIS

All assignment work is completed **directly on RIS**. You should not run analyses locally on your laptop unless explicitly instructed.

### Working on Assignments
- Each assignment has a designated location within the BIO 5488 course directory on RIS: ```/storage1/fs1/workshops/Active/BIO5488/SP2026.L41.BIOL.5488.01/Assignments```
- You will copy assignment materials into your personal working directory  
- Analyses are run using the command line and, when required, submitted as jobs to compute nodes  
- Output files (results, logs, figures) must be clearly organized and labeled  

### Turning In Assignments
- Submission is done by placing required files into the specified **submission directory** on RIS  
- Only files located in the correct submission directory at the deadline will be graded  
- You are responsible for verifying that:
  - All required files are present  
  - Files are readable and complete  
  - Output matches the assignment instructions  

Specific submission paths, required filenames, and deadlines are provided with each assignment.

---

## Expectations

- All analyses must be run on RIS  
- Assignments must follow the provided structure  
- Clear file organization and documentation are required  
- Academic integrity and reproducibility are expected

We look forward to working with you as you build practical genomics and bioinformatics skills in BIO 5488.
